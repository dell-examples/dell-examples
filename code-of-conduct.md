# Dell Community Code of Conduct


Dell is a community of brilliant and talented individuals with unique backgrounds and perspectives. As a result, through discussions and discourse, it is common to find that we don't always agree one with another. When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Dell Community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of Dell Community comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.   

- Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.  
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
- Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxxing").
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.

Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Dell Community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Dell community.
- Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
- Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- Be friendly and patient.
